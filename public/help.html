    <h1>splash-js help</h1>
      <p>This page will give some information about how
      <a href="splash.html">splash-js</a> can be used</p>
      <p class="text-danger">REMEMBER: no information is saved until you export
      and download the changes</p>
      <h2>Loading files</h2>
        <p>You can load one competition file and multiple club files</p>
      <h2>Work flow</h2>
        <p>To enter a compition, you have to load a competition file (.lxf or
        lef file received from the orginisation) with the left browse
        button:</p>
        <div>
          <label for="meetFile">Competition</label>
          <input class="btn btn-default" type="file" /><br />
        </div>
        <p>You can only load 1 competition file at a time. When you load an
        other file, the previous file is discarded</p>
        <p>After loading the competition file, you can use one of the following
        ways to create a club (on the right side of the screen):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>load a previous competition file;</li>
          <li>load a previous exported club file;</li>
          <li>Use the add Club button.<button class="btn btn-default btn-sm"
            type="button">Add Club</button></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Viewing the sessions</h3>
        <p>After loading the competition, you can see the details of the event
        clicking on the orange button.</p>
        <p>When clicking on the session date (+ time) you will get the list of
        events. Under these events the athletes will be shown who participate
        in the events</p>
        <h3>Subscribe athletes to the events</h3>
        <p>To subscribe to an event, you have to click on an athlete and choose
        "Competition" then a list of available events are shown. Use the
        checkbox to subscribe to the event and choose a time from the select
        box, or enter a time.</p>
        <h3>Saving the changes</h3>
        <p>To save the changes, you have to use the <button
          class="btn btn-default btn-sm" type="button">Export</button> button
        and then use the "download" link to save the changes to a file.</p>
        <p>The exported competition can be send to the organisation. The
        exported club(s) can be used to load the club again for a next
        competition.</p>
